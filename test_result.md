# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

## user_problem_statement: "Make me a simple fully working website from one run: it will be a template i will be able to host on my ubuntu 24.04 server, that has ufw, and be easy to auto write posts to it and update it without the need of coding and secure, it will have admin page, that i will have to login with password i defined and username and it won't be hackable or code injection-able. make the default login admin:admin and then it to ask for it to be changed once user logs in, and make sure i can add new admins or users to the website and have permission system, so i could give them all access, or just to see or to only edit certain parts of sites like blogs but not main page, or only read or only write, or only make new blog posts but not edit the old ones just read them or not read them but only ones they made. make my website more like a CMS. go through the code and make sure it is fully working with docker and deployable with it and easy to do that. also add script to stop and remove fully from docker, and the other ones to install docker and deploy all of them should be merged into one script that asks what you want to do with a menu to select from 1 to 3... and etc.. on the admin panel or in a script whatever is easier add option to backup whole site and settings, like the posts and users and everything and an easy way to load those back in or merge. all of the things I told you to change you only change in case those features and things don't already exist, if they do just make sure they're working as intended. Also go through the project see if there are any features or things that my previous developer or ai agent didn't finish and left cut out or unfinished and just finish them. also remove all the files and folders and other things that are no longer used and are just clutter and making this harder than this has to be so make everything simple. make sure this app is ready to deploy, doesn't have exploits or code injection or is able to be hacked easily. I want to make this a project I can publish on github and anyone can use as template for their personal site on which they can post and then customize with own posts and title and everything else. it's supposed to be a retro looking personal website template fully working and ready to deploy on docker running on port 8080, that has style inspired from windows server 2000/ windows xp/ windows 7 aero.. a personal website that will have main page, and pages like blog contact and admin, that are fully implemented and working, blog would have blog posts and they will also be searchable by their title tag or date of posting or author, contact page will be working and it will be stored on the website it will also not be hackable ddosable or spammable there will be cooldown and temporary ip block and etc.. the admin page will be extensive admin page where you can edit most aspects of the website, you can use good editor to edit the home page, write new pages that will appear in navbar, write blog posts and it will be good editor with features from markdown or something else, the admin page will also have permission manager and users, statistics for the website what page is visited how many times the browsers the ips and countries for that user, changing name of website port and other config, to see the contact forms submitted and reply to them by opening a mailto link in users default mail client and forwarding title of the contact with the RE: appended to it and the content of the mail too with > at the end where i'd write my reply. Major improvements: 1) Change port from 80 to 8080 in Docker configuration 2) Implement Gallery page with actual image gallery functionality 3) Clean up unnecessary files and folders 4) Make the website more generic template instead of 'Sectorfive' branding."
